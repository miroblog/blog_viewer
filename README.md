## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

#### Method 1: Direct Deployment with Vercel CLI

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't have one
2. Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

3. Run the deployment command from your project root:

```bash
vercel
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment
5. For production deployment:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### Method 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project:

```bash
# Initialize git repository if not done already
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. Connect Vercel with your GitHub repository:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Add New" > "Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js configuration
   - Click "Deploy"

3. Configure automatic deployments:
   - Vercel will automatically deploy when you push changes to your GitHub repository
   - By default, every push to the main branch triggers a production deployment
   - Pull requests will create preview deployments

4. Custom settings (optional):
   - In your project settings on Vercel, you can customize:
     - Environment variables
     - Build commands
     - Domain settings
     - Team permissions

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

#### Method 1: Using gh-pages package (Configured)

This project is already configured for GitHub Pages deployment using the `gh-pages` package.

1. The `next.config.js` has been configured for static export with GitHub Pages:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // Enable static exports
  output: 'export',
  // Configure base path for GitHub Pages
  basePath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/tech-blog-md-viewer' : '',
  // Disable image optimization since it's not supported in static exports
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  // Other configurations...
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

2. The `package.json` includes scripts for building and deploying to GitHub Pages:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev -p 3001",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "export": "next build",
  "deploy": "touch out/.nojekyll && gh-pages -d out -t true"
}
```

3. To deploy to GitHub Pages, run:

```bash
# Build the static site
npm run export

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

4. The site will be deployed to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository and will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/tech-blog-md-viewer`

#### Method 2: Using GitHub Actions (Alternative)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
git push
```

5. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select the `gh-pages` branch and save
   - Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete
   - Your blog will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`

#### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. Update your `package.json` to include a build and export script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev -p 3001",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "export": "next build && next export"
}
```

2. Build and export your project:

```bash
npm run export
```

3. Create a new GitHub repository if you haven't already

4. Initialize Git in your project folder (if not already done):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

5. Create and switch to a `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

6. Remove all files except the `out` directory:

```bash
git rm -rf .
git clean -fxd
```

7. Copy the contents of the `out` directory to the root:

```bash
cp -r out/* .
rm -rf out
```

8. Create a `.nojekyll` file to bypass GitHub Pages Jekyll processing:

```bash
touch .nojekyll
```

9. Commit and push to the gh-pages branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push -u origin gh-pages --force
```

10. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings as described in Method 1, step 5
